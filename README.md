Demo: https://youtu.be/86XoI5EdNHo

Description:
Sleepless Soul is a first person horror game, where the player is trapped in a haunted
farmhouse with the ghost of a young girl who died tragically many years ago. The player must
avoid the angry specter as they search around the house for something that can put the girlâ€™s
soul at rest.

High Concept:
Sleepless Soul is a horror game where a ghost haunts the halls of an abandoned farmhouse.
The player cannot fight the ghost, but is trapped in the house until they are able to pacify the
ghost. So the player must avoid getting caught by the ghost as they search around the house
for some way to calm the spirit and hopefully escape. The player needs to navigate the dark
house, opening doors to access new rooms and using their trusty flashlight to look for clues into
the story of the girl haunting the house
